# AutoCharts

AutoCharts is a program that automatically updates the Catalyst/Rational/Strategy Shares fund fact sheets and other marketing material every quarter when new financial data is available. This is a program designed with various technologies like AutoIt, Node.JS, and amCharts.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following installed on your system:
* Node.JS
* Dropbox
* Microsoft Excel
* Adobe InDesign
* Datalinker Plugin for Adobe InDesign
* Firefox

Please note that Node.js is included in the installer file for AutoCharts2.0. So it should install for you if you have not installed seperately.

The Smart Sync "AutoCharts&Tables" folder in the shared Dropbox folder must be set to Local. For more information on Dropbox's Smart Sync, go here:
