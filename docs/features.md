# Features of AutoCharts

## Sync with Dropbox

To sync AutoCharts with Dropbox, all you need to do is go to the main menu and select "Pull Data from Dropbox"

?> **Tip** AutoCharts will also sync with Dropbox automatically when you click the "Process Updates" button.

## Create Archive of Fact Sheets

You can easily create an archive of the InDesign and Backup Files located in Dropbox by selecting "File" in the main menu and then "Create Factsheet Archive"

AutoCharts will ask you where you would like to save your archive. Once AutoCharts has finished archiving, you will find your file with the following name:

<span>FactSheets_[Your Name]_[Current Quarter]-[Current Year].zip</span>


## Automated Logging

As you use AutoCharts to update marketing materials, the program will automatically create a log file for you to reference later.

To access this log file, select "Help" in the main menu and then "Open Log File"

You may also clear the log file easily by selecting "Clear Log File" in the "Help" menu.
